## User Experience (UX)

I have attampted to create an uncluttered and  responsive site with a very simple and clean home page where the main feature is an inviting backround and an easy access to The Cake page where a range of products is displayed.  Full viewport sets the tone for the rest of the site. The goal is to give a clear idea of products offered and use bright and inviting colours.
The header and footer design is identiacal throughout the site on all pages for continuity.

Home page:
The home page design is very simple - the main feature is a  relavant background photo that covers the full viewport. The goal is to give a clear inclination of products offered and easy access to product display page.
In the center a jumbotron was used, within which is a Button Link The Cakes page. This will allow and easy and quick access to viewing products.
This is part of concept for the site has many sections interlinked from different places, which I feel makes it more accessible.

Cakes page:
The simple and responsive layout is achieved by using a flex system with different areas for a list of products offered, divided into main English/French/Lithuanian sections as well as photos to give clear idea of product enhance the visual experience. 
There is a link to the ordering page from the bottom of each product card as well as an easy option of getting back to Home page by clicking on the Logo at the top of page.

Order page:
The main feature of the Order page is a Form Section, giving options for enetering diiferent satyle data and submitting information via clickable button once user is ready to send the order/request.
It also has a full background cover image to keep in style with the rest of the site and within bakery theme.

About Us page:
About page follows the theme with a another background image,  includes some information with contact details and a map as well as a booking form. The contact details include a telephone number and email address that can be clicked through for a seamless experience. There is also a form where clients can submit a request to receive the company newsletter.

Due to having a few large images on the site which took long to load and for the purpose of improving user experience, I have compressed the images using tinypng.com Total reduction in image size has been 53% (7MB).
